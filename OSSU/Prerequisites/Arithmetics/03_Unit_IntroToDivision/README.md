# Unit 3: Intro to division

Мы все знаем, что умножение это всего лишь повторяющееся сложение, но что такое деление? Думайте об этом как о повторяющемся вычитании! В этой главе вы узнаете как легко производить деление и расширите свой математический набор инструментов дальше.

## Lesson 1: Division intro

### Division as equal groups

### Division with groups of objects

### Visualizing division with arrays

### Divide with visuals

## Lesson 2: Relating multiplication and division

### Relating division to multiplication

### Relate division to multiplication

### Relate multiplication and division equations

### Multiplication word problem: parking lot

The local grocery store opens at 9. Its parking lot has 6 rows. Each row can fit 7 cars. Each car has 4 wheels. How many cars can the parking lot fit?

~~~
r = rows = 6
c = cars per row = 7

p = parking lot

p = r * c
p = 6 * 7 
p = 42

The parking lot can fit 42 cars.

### Division word problem: school building

The new headquarters of Khan Academy is at 314 Math Avenue. It has 200 windows and has 7 stories. The parking lot can fit 90 cars. The building itself is 63 feet tall. Haw tall is each story?

~~~
s = stories = 7
t = tall = 63

st = store tall

st = t / s
st = 63 / 7
st = 9 feet

Each story is 9 feet tall.

### Multiplication word problem: soda party

How many liters of soda do we have for the party?

20 people are coming to the party.

We have purchased 5 bottles of soda for the party.

The party will last for 3 hours.

Each bottle has 2 liters of soda.

6 bottles of soda were used a picnic last week.

~~~
b = bottles = 5
l = liters of soda in one bottle = 2
t = total

t = b * l
t = 5 * 2
t = 10

We have 10 liters of soda for the party.

### Division word problem: blueberries

Kali is having a picnic for her 6 friends. The oldest friend, Vikram, is 10 years old. The youngest, Diya, is 6 years old. She has a total of 48 blueberries and wants to split them evenly between her friends. 

How many blueberries does each friend get?

~~~
f = friends = 6
t = total blueberries = 48
b = each friend

b = t / f
b = 48 / 6
b = 8
~~~
Each friend gets 8 bluberries.
